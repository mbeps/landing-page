The `src` directory is where the main source code for a Next.js project resides. This directory contains sub-directories that organize the different types of code in the project.

# **Subdirectories**
## **`components`**
The `components` directory contains the UI components used across the application. These components are reusable building blocks that encapsulate the logic and functionality of a particular part of the user interface. Using components in a React project modularizes the codebase, promotes code reuse, and makes it easier to manage and maintain the application.

## **`app`**
The app section explains the new feature in Next.js 13 that allows you to create layouts, nested routes, and use server components by default. It also describes how the app directory works with the pages directory and how to use optional files like loading.tsx, error.tsx, and template.tsx to customize the UI for each route. It also warns that the app directory is still in beta and not recommended for production use.
