The app section explains the new feature in Next.js 13 that allows you to create layouts, nested routes, and use server components by default. It also describes how the app directory works with the pages directory and how to use optional files like loading.tsx, error.tsx, and template.tsx to customize the UI for each route. It also warns that the app directory is still in beta and not recommended for production use.

# **Server Components**
Server components in Next.js 13 are React components that run on the server and return compiled JSX to the client. They are ideal for rendering page skeletons, fetching data from the server, and passing it to client components. Server components have the following characteristics:
- They use the `.server.js` or `.server.tsx` extension.
- They can utilize Node.js modules, libraries, and server-side resources without worrying about bundling or compatibility.
- They have access to environment variables, files, databases, etc.
- They cannot use browser APIs or perform DOM manipulation.

# **Layouts**
Layouts in Next.js 13 are foundational components that wrap pages and provide a consistent UI across them. They are powered by server components and support nested layouts with colocated data fetching. Key features of layouts include:
- They use the `layout.server.js` or `layout.server.tsx` extension.
- They can fetch data for the entire application or specific route groups.
- Nested layouts can be created by placing them inside subdirectories.
- They can receive props from parent layouts or page components and pass props to child layouts or the page component.
- They can render a `<Head>` component to modify the document's `<head>`.

# **Nested Routes**
Nested routes in Next.js 13 are routes that have a parent-child relationship with other routes. They are useful for creating complex UIs with multiple levels of navigation and hierarchy. Important details about nested routes include:
- They require placing a `page.server.js` or `page.server.tsx` file inside a subdirectory of the app directory.
- Deeper levels of nesting can be achieved by adding more subdirectories.
- They can receive props from parent routes or layouts and pass props to child routes or layouts.
- They can render a `<Link>` component to navigate between routes without page reload.

# **Loading States**
Loading states in Next.js 13 are optional components that display a loading indicator while pages are being rendered. They are beneficial for enhancing user experience and providing feedback during data fetching. Loading states have the following characteristics:
- They use the `loading.server.js` or `loading.server.tsx` extension.
- They can be defined at the root level or within subdirectories.
- They can receive props from parent loading states or page components and pass props to child loading states or the page component.
- They can render a `<Spinner>` component to show a spinning animation while loading.
